              The journey of a founder-led sales organization is not for the faint of heart. It's a commitment to excellence that extends far beyond conventional business hours. Birthdays, anniversaries, and relationships become variables in an equation where success is the only constant.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">THE PRICE OF PROGRESS</h3>
            <p className="normal-case">
              What separates exceptional founders from the rest is their willingness to "chew glass" - to embrace the uncomfortable, the challenging, and the downright painful aspects of building a business. This isn't about glorifying hustle culture; it's about understanding the real cost of creating something truly valuable.

              - Stable monthly recurring revenue (MRR)<br/>
              - Month-over-month enterprise account growth<br/>

              - 10x price-to-earnings ratios
            </p>

            <p className="normal-case">
              This isn't about short-term gains. It's about building a foundation so solid that it can support the weight of enterprise-scale growth. The sacrifices made today are investments in tomorrow's success.

              <p className="normal-case">
                Success in B2B SaaS isn't just about product-market fit or technical excellence. It's about the founder's commitment to seeing it through, no matter the personal cost. The question isn't whether you'll face these challenges, but whether you're prepared to overcome them.
