            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">THE COCKPIT PARADIGM</h3>
            <p className="normal-case">
              Fighter pilots don't navigate through nested menus in combat. They use direct, tactile controls and heads-up displays that prioritize immediate access to critical functions. This same principle is revolutionizing modern software design.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">THE RETURN TO TACTILE</h3>
            <p className="normal-case">
              Key characteristics of this new interface paradigm:

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">THE EFFICIENCY PARADIGM</h3>
            <p className="normal-case">
              Like a well-designed cockpit, modern interfaces are embracing the beauty of purpose-built design. Every element serves a function, every interaction has meaning, and the aesthetic emerges from this perfect alignment of form and function.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">THE FUTURE INTERFACE</h3>
            <p className="normal-case">
              We're entering an era where software interfaces feel more like mission control centers - powerful, responsive, and intelligently designed. The goal isn't to hide complexity, but to make it accessible through thoughtful, direct interaction patterns.

              <p className="normal-case">
                The most effective interfaces of tomorrow will blend the directness of command-line interfaces with the spatial awareness of cockpit displays and the intelligence of AI. This isn't about following trends - it's about rediscovering what truly works.
