            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">THE ENTERPRISE CHASM</h3>
            <p className="normal-case">
              The critical mistake? Allowing a competitor to capitalize on your market validation.

            <p className="normal-case">
              For founders seeing early product-market fit, the question isn't whether to pursue enterprise customers, but when and how. The tools and infrastructure exist - the main barrier is strategic commitment and execution.
