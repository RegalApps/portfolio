            <p className="normal-case">
              Imagine a world where complex software workflows are reduced to natural conversations. Where instead of navigating through multiple screens and menus, you simply tell an AI agent what you want to accomplish. This isn't science fiction - it's the immediate future of software design.

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 normal-case">
              <li>Focus shifts from visual design to interaction flows</li>
              <li>Understanding AI capabilities becomes crucial</li>
              <li>Emphasis on conversation design</li>
              <li>New metrics for measuring success</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</h3>
            <p className="normal-case">
              Early adopters of AI agent interfaces will have a significant advantage. Users who experience the efficiency and naturalness of agent-based interactions will find traditional interfaces cumbersome and outdated.

              <p className="normal-case">
                The future of software isn't about better buttons or smoother animations - it's about invisible interfaces powered by intelligent agents. Product designers and developers must adapt to this new reality or risk becoming as obsolete as the interfaces they create.
